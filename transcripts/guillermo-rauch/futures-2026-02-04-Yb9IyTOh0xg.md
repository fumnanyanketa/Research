I'll say one thing about VIP coding.
It's really easy to go from zero to one.
I think we've all seen the demos of I
prom thing and it's cool. I think what's
harder is to iterate on a project at
scale and to deploy changes safely.
Every marketer ever sells to change this
page at some point and the old way was
one of two ways. One is what I called
you had to petition to the government.
You had to go to engineers and say,
"Engineers, can you please add a logo
over here or whatnot or pray that the
CMS was perfectly wired up for any
ambition or dream or idea you had. So
now they can just open this page in VZ
and prompt anything that they want.
&gt;&gt; It reduces the friction of getting
something live really, really low. the
humiliation ritual of prioritization
goes away and you can actually focus
your time on defending the merits of an
idea on the actual idea as opposed to
the hypothesis of the idea that then has
to be implemented. And so I think it
changes the speed of companies in a
really significant way.
So this is truly a first time vibe
podcast that we're doing together and I
wanted to introduce myself. I'm Claire
Vo. of a product leader and obsessed
with AI and I have a podcast, How I AI,
where I teach people how to build better
with all these new tools, including ones
that we're going to see today. And I'm
really excited to have you here, G.
First, we're just going to get to the
the thing that everybody's wondering
about. What is your most favorite
feature that you released this week on
VZero?
&gt;&gt; Well, I'll tell you the hottest thing in
AI today is skills. Everyone is excited
about the fact that we can now augment
agents and AI applications and agentic
engineering with skills like skills that
the model doesn't yet have. And so we
launched skills.sh
and the beautiful thing about what we'll
show you today is that Vzero can
seriously go from prototype all the way
to production. So we're able to conceive
changes to things like skills.sh. I'm
going to show you really quickly.
Skills.sh SH is a new you can think of
it as like npm. It's a hub an open
ecosystem of skills and it's pretty
dramatic what's happening to this site.
So you can see that we now have 34,000
skills submitted by the community and
this website has gone viral all over the
internet. It's hosted on Verscell but
the most exciting part to me is that it
was conceived in Bzero.
&gt;&gt; I have a quick question for the
audience. How many of you have installed
a skill in the last week?
&gt;&gt; Oh wow.
&gt;&gt; Okay. A lot of people
&gt;&gt; skill build.
&gt;&gt; Um, how many of you have the top three
installed?
&gt;&gt; Actually, top
&gt;&gt; it's very heavy at the top. Right. It's
like
&gt;&gt; these are ripping.
&gt;&gt; Oh, no. I have top seven. Okay. Yeah, I
have the top seven installed right now.
Um, this is a really great resource. So,
for folks that are maybe watching this
later or haven't been familiar with
skills, skills is now this standard that
a lot of these agentic frameworks are
using. to help you repurpose and reuse
best practices, step-by-step flows. And
so, for example, I use this Remotion
best practices one um to let me import
components and regularly create videos
really, really quickly. And I would not
have been able to do this without the
expertise that's been packaged in these
best practices that were installed with
one line um using skills.sh. I think
it's also worth noting maybe to peel the
covers of how Versel builds products.
&gt;&gt; Yep.
&gt;&gt; Skills out a stage was a thing that was
just conceived at the moment of
inspiration. We started prompting, hey,
wouldn't it be cool
&gt;&gt; if this thing took shape?
&gt;&gt; Would we discussed for example what it
should look like? We we've been calling
this style terminal core because it
looks a little bit like this is my
contribution to the project. I was like,
hey, wouldn't it be cool if we make the
top of the website look like a terminal?
And so the the the process itself of
building this was very much prompt
driven I'll say like chatting in Slack
and saying hey wouldn't it be nice if we
had a hub for this just very iterative
very collaborative between the team
members at Verscell and what's really
cool about this again is it's really
fast so it takes advantage of all the
versel infrastructure primitives even
though it has 35,000 of the skills like
if I start like like hardcore scrolling
this and then pick a random one. All
right, Swift Taylor Swift. You're going
to see like the page transitions are are
swift to UI. Okay, but uh like all the
page transitions are instant production
grade. He needed to scale. There were
going to be a lot of eyes on this thing.
&gt;&gt; Okay. So, I think we want to get to our
first workflow for how AI and you just
want to show us how you either develop
this or how you and the team improve
this over time using the tool.
&gt;&gt; I'll say one thing about VIP coding.
Like I think we've all seen the demos of
I prom thing and it's cool and I think
what's harder is to iterate on a project
at scale and to deploy changes safely.
In in the case of how we work on versel
products, we always work on branches and
we take advantage of branch previews and
then we code review and then we merge
them. So what we're basically going to
be showing you today is how we brought
those ideas of hardcore
heavyduty
production grade engineering to visit.
So I'm here I'm binding that same
project that you just saw skills.sh
which is piped into is basically backed
by git the engineer who built this
pushed some code three hours ago and you
have this new button within v 0ero which
is a new branch. So what this is showing
you is that B 0 is making the git flow
of creating branches a first class
citizen of the product. So I'm going to
create a branch
and basically this is going to give me
the same sort of like chat experience
you're used to. But notice here at the
top I get this beautiful new convention
of project slash branch. Right? So I
have the v 0/rouchg
branch. And here within the preview,
you're going to notice that just like if
you had cloned the project to your local
device, we both have a full full scale
uh VS Code editor as well as the real
project running within VZ. One thing I
want to pause and notice because I just
have a laser eye for product is I love
that you use the convention that all of
us with engineering teams use on our git
branches which is who's the contributor
slash what's the feature and so what I
think this is really interesting you
know we're going to talk about how you
actually use these tools to build but I
also think there's a flip side of how
you design great um AI products and
agentic products and I still like the
small design tweaks that make something
like a vzero feel like a collaborative
teammate on your
So I for all the engineers out there, I
noticed I noticed that little
convention.
&gt;&gt; So I and what you're going to see in the
design philosophy of the product is that
we really wanted to embed those little
details of what makes a real engineering
workflow come to life, but in a really
easy way, right? Like at the end of the
day, I didn't have to go to a terminal
or boot up GitHub desktop and branch
manually. Like it's the stone age. I
just press a button and now I have a
branch running. So the main idea here is
that within this preview I have the full
skills.sh project running. It downloaded
dependencies. It installed the exact
versions of Nex.js and every dependency
uh within the project. I have it all
running here. I have it obviously within
a staging or dev sort of environment.
And now you know I I could navigate it
like uh I could navigate the production
website. I could explore it. I could,
you know, use all the capabilities that
Vzero uh brings to the table, but I
figured let's actually build a feature
that we could ship to prod.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And one thing I want to pause on
what you I think glossed over a little
bit, which is the fact that you have
this VS Code instance, the fact that you
have all your dependencies installed,
the fact that this is running both with
code and a preview. For anybody who's
less technical out there, and maybe a
lot of your users that are using
vzero.app app are less technical. This
even like downloading VS Code, getting
your local environment set up, like I
spent this morning with my designer
installing homebrew like like it just
wasn't on her laptop. And so
&gt;&gt; it's nightmare feel.
&gt;&gt; It's nightmare. And so if you're trying
to step from this like vibe coding
prototype in web experience into feeling
more like a software engineer without
having to have Claire handhold you
through like brew install, this gets you
like halfway there. And so I think
there's also this learning aspect of it
I want to make sure people don't miss.
But let's get into building something
obvious.
&gt;&gt; So one another part of our product
development process is really listening
to community and listening to customers.
So people have been asking for a lot of
different tools so that we could guide
them towards knowing if a skill is high
quality, vetted, verified because
there's so many skills. At last we
checked there were 500 skills being
added every hour. And so one of the
ideas that we came up with is like could
we add um a rating system. So let's add
a fivestarbased
rating system for the skills. Uh put it
on the sidebar.
Um be mindful. So I'll also give you
like a little bit of my real time
consciousness on if I were talking to an
engineer and say like what could go
wrong if we accept ratings from the
internet. One of the things that can go
wrong if you accept ratings from is
abuse. So let's say let's tell VZ be
mindful that uh we should rate limit or
prevent abuse on the scores that we
receive. And again, for me, it's all
about thinking from a production
readiness point of view when I think
about the new VZO and make it make sense
within the style of this skills website.
&gt;&gt; What I love about what you're showing us
is you have this very very high
sophistication prompt here, which is
make it make sense. So, we have three
three incomplete sentences on a
production app serving thousands,
millions of people. and you're going to
fire it off. And while you do this, one
of the things I want to just call out
that I think you know why this feature
is maybe important right now is I don't
know if you've heard there's like this
crustation crawling all over everybody's
MacBook minis and skills can be a a
prompt injected vector for things. And
so as you're trying to make sure that
this becomes the centralized hub for
discovering skills, which I think it's
starting to be, it is upon you to kind
of make sure that the quality is there,
at least you have the right thing um
right things in place so people can make
the decision to follow with your
analogy. This is a little bit like we're
vibe coding on top github.com or
npmjs.com. It's like a really really big
deal.
&gt;&gt; All right. So I was going to walk you
through what Vzero is doing which of
course if you've used V 0ero before we
everyone does the whole like talk over
the thinking trace because agents are
not the fastest but I do want to point
out a few things that are really
important. So um D0 is all about
leveraging the integration and
marketplace capabilities of RCEL. So in
this case it knows what the data source
is of this project right we're storing
data in reddis by app stash obviously
it's going to go through the whole file
system it's going to try to interpret my
requirements this is already like really
nice to see that it's not inventing a
new way to store the data like it's
actually paying attention to the data
that I use
um and so we'll take a look at uh again
here like it actually gave me something
that
meets my requirements right? Like it
fits within the design style. I can
submit a rating. It is stores the
rating. So I have now my fivestar one
rating. I guess I'm going to
&gt;&gt; It's terminal core
monace font.
&gt;&gt; Um let's refresh the page to see that
persistence actually works. Beautiful.
There's a tiny bit of layout shift that
triggers my neurosis. So we'll tell it,
hey, when we don't have data, make sure
there's no layout shift. By the way, for
those of you that are like less
neurotic, I guess. So, it bothered me
that when we refreshed the page, when we
didn't have data, like it jittered the
sidebar a little bit. So, we're just
going to have the zero.
&gt;&gt; So, while we're uh jibber jabbering
while the it's thinking, which I have to
get very good at as a podcast. So, I
will call out that I have observed a
Verscell internal hackathon and I have
seen this man screenshot like rounded
corners that are not right and just put
them in the chat with like a question
mark. And so it's it's yeah it it speaks
to my um
&gt;&gt; my very attention to detail heart that
you saw you saw that did it work.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. No, I'm fairly satisfied
like the Yeah.
&gt;&gt; The skeleton was stable.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Uh zero layout shift. So let's continue
with the we we talked about this uh
hardcore
uh engineering workflow like if if we
were making a change like this on skills
age again receiving hundreds of skills
per hour with lots of visitors we first
want to make sure that things work right
and right now you you can think of this
as a very capable dev environment we're
booting up the NexJS dev server in a
virtual machine it's it's it's basically
very true to the actual end result. In
fact, thank you to the Nex.js engineers
who sweated all of the details of
mirroring to the best of their ability
the dev environment and the production
environment. But there is another layer
of assurance that we can get, right,
which is so if you're more familiar with
the g like the GitHub world, the GitHub
side of things, you know that when you
push a new PR to GitHub, the this
beautiful Versel bot comes to sort of
save the day, right? you know that it
builds what you what you're changing and
then it previews it. Not only that, but
notice that Vzero really cooks. Vzero is
making me look so good here because I
haven't written a PR description in like
25 years 84 years. So Vzero produced a
PR described it um and then the magic of
our cell is coming in right so it's
giving me that uh preview. So I'm going
to I'm going to open it here. I'm going
to say visit preview. I I'm just again
I'm going to be a software engineer for
a second. Can we appreciate how quickly
that preview branch deployed?
&gt;&gt; Well, don't trigger me because it can be
10 times quicker. But yeah, I'm proud of
it.
&gt;&gt; Explain.
&gt;&gt; Now I have a production-like
environment. So when you see this URL
ending onverell.sh
is our enterprise versell environment.
That's why it had the 17 steps of
logging in. Um but this is basically
running on the production grade CDN on
the production grade rendering
infrastructure hosting infrastructure
etc. So now when I'm seeing that you
know rating there I have pretty pretty
good confidence. I was like yeah this is
shippable.
&gt;&gt; Okay so I have to ask a couple questions
about the you know inside the house view
of this. Is this how you all are
shipping code or is this a big chunk of
how you're shipping code to this? Is it
100%? How are you actually using this
for production?
&gt;&gt; So it's really interesting. We when we
cook on a on a project or a product
internally, we hold ourselves to the
same sort of high bar as if you had
launched a product externally because
you want to make sure that people are
actually adopting it, right? And so
before before we started chatting and
I'm going to give you a glimpse of again
the behind the scenes of Verscell, uh
we've talked a lot publicly about our
data analyst agent D0. Yes, we're very
creative with with names. We take the
first initial and we add a zero. So this
is our data uh AI powered assistant and
I was actually asking it um I said um
Vzero this is me by the way uh tell me
about PR's merged with Vzero in the
recent weeks tell me about its growth so
again PR's merged with DZ is a totally
novel thing and DZ cooked thank you DZ
it said PRs merged via DZ have seen
explosive growth in the last week wow
explo explosive growth.
&gt;&gt; I have to appreciate whoever prompt
managed this one because it did not put
the explosion of OG in there, which I
think would also trigger G.
&gt;&gt; All right, we should uh Yeah. Uh trigger
warning. Starting from near zero in
early January, the feature hit 3200 PR
submerged per day by January 2829, which
is basically today. An extraordinary
100x. The bots, the AIS do like to like
like Yeah. like sweet sweet tacas. But
um it's it's pretty amazing. So this is
in very very very early uh preview,
right? Like we we're just letting people
in. But I mean this is just such a
beautiful workflow. I mean imagine
triggering a task like this from your
phone, from Slack, from vzero.app.
Another convenience that we're adding is
that you can take a a U GitHub repo like
this and I can go to the homepage and
then I can paste it. And so now I could
import something that I already have and
create a chat from it. So anytime I have
an idea for a realworld project and
product that has in production, I can
now prompt. So I estimate that this is
going to change fundamentally how we
work, right? Uh it's also very visual in
nature which is really cool. Obviously,
there's a lot of ways of like getting
preview getting uh changes made by
agents today out out there in the world.
These everyone's very excited about what
what AI can do, but this is actually
showing me the the actual results and
like things that are going to happen.
So, I I grade this really high for the
kind of products that we build at VCell
and uh I expect this to continue to have
a lot of traction.
&gt;&gt; So, I have to ask you sort of
operationally, how do you imagine
companies do this? And one of the things
I'm thinking is I was chatting with
Caroline who interrupted you all and say
we're said we're going to start the
podcast and she said last night I was
prepping for this demo and I vzero coded
something and somebody saw it and was
like well that's a good idea you should
just merge it and ship it like do you
imagine or inside the company who's
shipping code how are you enabling that
as a CEO how does the culture support it
how does it not
&gt;&gt; until now everyone could cook right
everyone could create a prototype a new
design a suggestion. In fact, uh, moment
of vulnerability because I haven't
really even opened this in a while, but
like, uh, let's see if I have I probably
created a bunch of things that I've been
suggesting to the teams that we could
look at, right? Um, ignore this one for
a second, but um, so anytime I have an
idea on how to improve the product, I
nowadays create a Vzero. Now the
difference is that until I had this
mechanism to hand it off as a pull
request to the engineering team then I
was kind of like playing in La La Lands.
I was like in out there in this like
prototype world and now we have a common
foundation and a common substrate so
that if you have an idea whether you
work in marketing like marketers always
want to change the website like imagine
like go to verscell.com I'll show you a
page that is actually quite uh fun at
versell so our enterprise page every
marketer of versell wants to change this
page at some point right and the old way
was to one of one of two ways. One is
what I called you had to petition to the
government. You had to go to engineers
and say engineers please can you can you
please add a logo over here or whatnot
or pray that the CMS was perfectly wired
up for any ambition or dream or idea you
had. So now they can just open this page
in VZ and prompt anything that they
want. But it would be somewhat
irresponsible to just ship it, right? So
with the Git workflow and opening a PR
and being able to preview it, we can all
build confidence that it's going to be a
good change, roll it back if needed, and
and again, this is a website that's it's
pretty pretty large.
&gt;&gt; What I think is fun about this from an
org perspect perspective is it reduces
the friction of getting something live
really really low, right? And like the
changes the speed of companies in in a
really significant way. And you worked I
mean to say the least at launch darkly
&gt;&gt; and you know that a true production
grade release process involves things
like feature flags and experiments and
things need to be measured and there's
events that are critical to report from
these product surfaces. And so this is
also where I see the um skills that we
can add to vzero and that you can
contribute yourself to play a very
important role because sometimes you
know like we're all operating on this
like websites and pixels and whatnot and
we say like ah it's seems easy how risky
could it be to move this button 20
pixels to the right and so I think we
can make vibe coding scale to that kind
of rigor that exists within enterprises
and companies at scale
&gt;&gt; well and if we're being honest on that
enterprise it's not going to be moving a
button two pixels. It's going to be
switching the emphasis. I know this cuz
I spent my life in enterprise. Switching
the emphasis between contact sales and
view the product. There's going to be a
perpetual debate which one's the primary
call to action and which is the
secondary.
&gt;&gt; Okay. I we so we've shown uh new v0ero
import GitHub which I think is really
great. Do a pull request. Copy and paste
your GitHub URL in to import it.
Actually push to production. Make
friends with your engineers. three
sentence prompting, no more than that. I
want to go to quick because we want to
keep this tight. I want to go to a quick
lightning round with you and ask you a
couple different AI questions. So, what
is your favorite non I mean everything's
a coding use case, I'm sure, with you,
but what is your favorite non-coding use
case of AI?
&gt;&gt; Well, I'm conflicted. My mind
immediately went to image generation
because I used uh so we built a banger
playground. Uh I don't want to share
screen again. I want to take it from
you. But
&gt;&gt; this is Oh, no. I was just going to say
image generation is how I got this
pretty pretty background.
&gt;&gt; Um bzero nano banana
&gt;&gt; pro. Nano banana.
&gt;&gt; So what's really cool that's happening
at Verscell today is that we're building
so many of our own internal tools and
agents and so we're building our own
design tools like for example to create
new images. We created a playground for
Nan Banana and I use that a lot. So I
use it to make memes uh guilty is
charged. Uh, but I also use it when I
want to present information in really
cool ways. When I tweet, when I
sometimes I have to make u present my
vision in a way that's more like on the
image side of things. I combine it a lot
with vzero because nanobana is really
good at like again letting me fire off
20 generations in parallel and then pick
the one that I actually like and then I
toss it into v 0ero and then I actually
get more fidelity of what I want to
implement. So image generation is is a
big one, but also I'm very excited about
video generation. We're going to be
dropping something. I don't want to
spoil it too much. Uh we're going to be
dropping something uh on the video side
as well. Um and but yeah, all all AI is
uh I also I also kick off a lot of
research tasks like long horizon
research tasks. Uh yeah. So, one of the
things I want to call out from a Nano
Banana perspective on our podcast is
I've used Nano Banana to turn every
conversation, I think we're now at 118
workflows, every AI workflow that we
talk about on the podcast gets its own
pretty consistent nano banana
infographic. And so, I just think
there's just such undervalued use cases
in both idio uh image and videogen. And
I'm about to take this and turn them all
into little mini videos.
&gt;&gt; We also created a really awesome I don't
know if we've written about it yet. that
we're publishing on the blog post. We
have an uh OG image like open graph
card, Twitter card generator that we use
internally that combines uh more
traditional rendering techniques but
also image generation. So a bottleneck
in our team was sometimes literally like
can we get that social card to get the
announcement through the door.
&gt;&gt; And so now we we've also sort of
automated and identify that. Every day
we're basically asking ourselves how can
we build an agent that takes over a task
that we were previously giving to a
person and uh and typically the person
that was working on that task is now the
one creating the agent. Yeah. So
something we said at the beginning is we
want B zero to be really awesome for you
all to create agents not just
traditional web applications. So that's
that's basically the the the road map of
the product.
&gt;&gt; So I have to say uh my favorite so
that's your favorite use case. My
favorite use case of your use of VZero
which I don't know if you're you're
prepared for me to have this much
knowledge about what you vibe code is
your Asiato Asia chess game.
&gt;&gt; My kids are obsessed with this. They
think it's because they got the AI chess
board and now they're like playing chess
at various levels.
&gt;&gt; By the way, I learned a lot. So, so it
was really cool like during the holidays
I uh I'm a I'm kind of a visual person.
&gt;&gt; So, the chess AI thing has been done
before, but I imagined this sort of um
imagine like ESPN is is is is
broadcasting a a final of a chess match
and they're going over the shoulder of
each player and showing the the the
chessboard obviously in 3D. And so I I
figured could could V 0 generate 3D
code, right? Could it render with 3JS
and things like that a uh a live chess
match and could I have two AIs battle it
out? And so um I mean you could open it.
So the zero- chess-match.resellapp.
Um and the other thing the other thing I
wonder if I am SEOed or not.
&gt;&gt; You you're number one. Good job.
&gt;&gt; Oh, yes.
&gt;&gt; Oh, a little terminal core over here.
&gt;&gt; So, terminal core, of course. But, uh,
so what I did is I I I started streaming
the thinking tokens of the models. Uh,
apologies to Google in advance. Uh,
we're using a very old model of theirs
that is really cheap, but they're losing
two 225.
At least they got five in. So, you can
see the thinking tokens of the models.
This is combining all of the Versel AI
infrastructure. It's using a workflow so
the game could run forever. The game
could literally run forever or or until
I run out of tokens.
&gt;&gt; AI gateway.
&gt;&gt; Uh AI gateway of course because we can
change models like we could we could see
like Brock versus you know uh whatever
uh what dropped this week when threeax
thinking. Uh but also I learned chess
incidentally because not from these
guys. These guys are kind of dumb. Uh,
you can see how it thinks through what
piece to move and it says, "Oh, no,
because if I move it there, I'm going to
get F. So, I need to do this." So, this
is a fun visor created during the
holidays.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So, I need a kid core version of
this. Um, I also want to see how much
these models are spending to beat and
lose.
&gt;&gt; Well, beautiful thing about the AI
gateway is that we kind of report, you
know, for this prompt, how much did it
cost you with this model, etc. Um, but
see, so this is GPT open source which is
actually pretty decent and uh pretty
cheap. So
&gt;&gt; great. And then so on this so that's my
kids favorite your V0.
&gt;&gt; I don't know if they have a favorite my
V.
&gt;&gt; It's popular with kids. I also got
another parent reach out to me and say
like oh this really inspired us and
we're going to use Vzero together to
create more things.
&gt;&gt; My kids a a DAU on VZero. Don't worry
about it. So this is my second question
which is what is the last thing you
built with your kids that was really
fun. So the other day I brought them all
to the office and what we started vibe
coding is so now we want to do things
that are more like physical AI like
bring AI to the real world. I think it's
the next frontier and so at the office
we have a a thing called Vesta board
which is a board where you can basically
render things in the real world.
&gt;&gt; And I think I really broke their their
brains that day. Not all of them because
I I brought four of them and one was on
his iPad not paying attention. It was
almost like bringing them to Sunday
school for what it's worth. Uh but two
of them were like, "Holy crap, you can
type in code and then you can change the
real world." So I kind of taught them
the concept of an API. Uh and yeah, all
vibe coded and um I I took one of the
nannies too and she was mind-blown.
&gt;&gt; Well, that is teaching everyone how to v
code. That is uh you and I we're like
twin stars here because while you have
the Vesta board which is pretty big, I
have this like tiny like 32x32 pixel
fake little mini computer that my kids
and I are like vibe coding little
screens on and little games on. So I
completely agree. Take it off the screen
for many reasons. If you have kids, put
it in the real world and you can do some
fun stuff and blow their mind.
&gt;&gt; Sending a packet and responding to it.
And the beautiful thing about Vzero and
things like this is like you're
literally speaking English to the
computer. So I think if you can teach
them that they can express their
thoughts and desires, then they can make
anything happen.
&gt;&gt; Okay, important question. Are you
teaching your kids to type?
&gt;&gt; That's a tough one because I was when I
grew up in Argentina, my dad got me this
soccer game. He tricked me. I thought,
"Oh, he's getting me FIFA or something
cool." No, he got me a soccer typing
game.
So to score, I had to type really fast.
And that's how you learn to type really
fast. But nowadays, like they're kind of
getting really into the the speech to
text thing. I need to find that hack
where like, "Oh, I got you Roblox." And
it's not. It's just typing.
&gt;&gt; It's just typing. So, I uh I I'm
tricking my youngests right now. We have
a Switch and I really want to play
Ocarina of Time for people that were
born when that game came out a million
years ago. And the only reason I let him
play it is it's like 99% just reading.
&gt;&gt; And so I'm like, you can play this very
slow paced game. It's a game. It's
really just going NPC to NPC and reading
to
&gt;&gt; phrases. So we played a game like this
with my kids during the holiday break.
Um it was basically like a puzzle math
game that looked like a game and that
inspired. So okay, good and bad. The
good was the game was like really
educational. The bad was like it was
like at ridden brain rot slop.
And so it's like okay huge opportunity
for someone to create a game platform.
You can combine all of these models. You
can do image generation for the assets.
We're about to drop something insanely
cool text to SVG. There's models that
now produce really really high qual.
We're going to uh share recraft models
through the Verscell AI gateway. So you
can create assets that are beautiful
game ready scalable in high DPI screens
whatever iPad. And so I really I I I I
see the future of really high quality
content uh at our fingertips uh and
getting rid of all this slop.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Well, um I you know my my future
roadmap releases are not as confidential
as yours and so I am in the back of my
mind working on like Mama Claire's dojo
for Crack Little Hackers.
&gt;&gt; Nice.
&gt;&gt; So maybe someday and deployed on
obviously Verscell. Okay, last question.
Uh, do you when you're frustrated prompt
AI the same way I have seen you prompt
in Zoom chat which is explain how do you
how do you how do you yeah question mark
like what do you do when it's not giving
you what you want? So I I do think that
what we what we're dropping now is going
to help you so much for the moments
where I mean let's be real you can get
stuck with AI right but now that you can
essentially have this full like let's
call it escape hatch right like you can
if you want you can clone the repo and
keep cooking on your local machine or if
you need some someone else to help you
this is fundamentally a collaborative
medium that's the thing that GitHub
unlocked for the world collaboration
between engineers designers marketers
and So um I I foresee that a lot less
people are going to get stuck frankly.
The models also keep getting smarter.
Skills is going to help you a lot as
well. So I'll give you an example. We
are always adding new frameworks and new
capabilities and XJS is getting more
powerful and the AI SDK now that we have
skills for those that we're going to
preload into vo the model itself is not
going to get it stuck as easily because
now it has more resources to like figure
out how to solve that problem. Another
thing that I've done it actually used it
for this project. So there's a lot of
subtleties about this this 3D thing that
I didn't know anything about 3D. So
whenever I would get stuck, I would ask
other models. Um I think it was
something about um the way that and
kudos to the um awesome soul the the the
gentleman that uh open sourced the 3D.
So I got it from Sketch Fab and he
didn't design this for creating a game
or anything like that. So all of the
pieces were stuck together. It was
almost like you had 3D printed it and
the pieces were stuck together with the
board. And so I obviously I want that
sweet animation that when the model
decides it moves the piece, right? Um
and so I had to ask a lot of questions
to other models about, hey, teach me
what's going on with this 3D thing. How
do I how do I reason about it? And then
I would copy what another model tells me
and I would toss it into Vzero. So, uh,
another thing that you can do when you
get stuck is you you she she can't see
it here because it's only for me, but
there's a debug button. And what the
debug button says, I asked Bzero, "Hey,
give me debugging tools so that I can
visualize the mesh of the 3D model. I
can visualize, I can turn the textures
on and off." And so the the AI itself
can help itself and can give you tools
to debug problems, which is kind of
meta, but try it. Try it and it's going
to work well for you.
&gt;&gt; Okay. So, you you ask an expert, which
is another model. I mean, find out the
right question to ask. Well, this has
been very fun. Thank you for showing us
a little bit behind the curtain of how
you use Vzero, all the new stuff, some
of the ways you use it in your personal
life and fun projects. We love to see
it. So, you have this new VZ. You have
this room full of people. What do you
want from them? What What can they do
for you?
&gt;&gt; I mean, get busy shipping. So, try it
out. Uh give us feedback. Uh we will fix
it as very very fast because we're going
to be dog eating our own dog food. Uh
and yeah share the things that you built
uh with Vzero.
&gt;&gt; Oh we have a question back here. Oh I
love it.
&gt;&gt; So I had a question. Thank you for
sharing like the feedback process how
you loop um in terms of like from
ideation to like production like during
that process do you do any like product
market fit? How do you validate that
what you're trying to build is actually
like useful or um impactful for like
your ecosystem? Yeah, super hot off the
presses new sort of mental model that
we've been using internally. There's a
customer zero and a customer one.
Customer zero, we like to to be
ourselves.
We uh it's like the Rick Rubin, the
confidence in our ability to know what's
good, whatever. Like we like our taste.
We we've been around the block for a
while. We want we have ideas of products
that we would like to see out there in
the in the universe. Uh but customer one
is also really important like a closed
design partner Claire Vo.
&gt;&gt; Oh
&gt;&gt; Claire Vzero and our Claire and our our
CPO are constantly texting.
&gt;&gt; We're on a text chain.
&gt;&gt; She she she texts bug reports. She texts
things she needs. So having that group
of design partners, enterprise
companies, individuals, community
members, people that slide into my XVMs.
So it's you always wanted that pressure
test of of the world. And for skills it
was that you know people telling us hey
like why does Opus 4.5 kind of know the
latest XJS but not really and how can we
embed your best practices. So that was
kind of like in in our backlog like we
were thinking about that problem for a
while but then it also became really
concrete. We were like okay how would we
go about distributing and discovering
the skills and so sort of the idea
became very complete and that's where a
tool like Vzero really helps you because
when you want to extract it out of your
mind you can just vero it and so pretty
much what you see today it started with
a like four or five vzero prompts in a
conversation with our VP of design who
then took it way further and made it
actually good and um and uh our our CTO
and our and our product leader. So you
mentioned about BMs, is there a
possibility of having React Native in
Visero?
&gt;&gt; So what you saw today is if you if you
if you pee the covers of how Vero is
built is built on a bunch of Verscell
infrastructure that you also all have
access to the the virtual machine that
we use to run that Nex.js preview is
called sandbox. So the Verscell sandbox
and it's a very powerful computer. In
fact, what's actually making agents
really capable is not that they're
perfect, is that they have a computer at
their disposal in order to solve every
any problem. So, the reason we showed
you a glimpse of how we work internally
with DZ. The reason DZero is so good at
data analysis is that it has a computer
where it can do research, it can write
Python code, it can run it, it can make
a look up to Snowflake, it can search
the web, it can come back, it can fix
it. It's like it's like a four or five
minute process, right? And so these
computers are very powerful general
purpose computers. You could imagine
them running React Native. You could
imagine them writing other programming
languages. They can obviously already
write Python and run it. And so the
sky's is the limit from that
perspective.
&gt;&gt; I have a question on that topic. Is
there going to be a point at which Vzero
is going to help you build those agents?
&gt;&gt; Oh, absolutely. So the main the main
idea of this chess thing, it's cute, but
I mentioned the word workflow. So it's
actually tricky for me to say this
program is going to run forever in the
presence of network or compute failures.
So in fact like uh you know we're doing
this live and just randomly came up with
the idea. The reason I had confidence
the demo was going to work is that if an
LLM provider is down or a function call
dies or times out or whatever the
workflow engine of our cell will say
we're doing live. We're going to try it
again and we're going to try it again
and we're going to try it again. What
we're going to help you do is create
those kind of workflows from within v
0ero. A lot of agents need that kind of
reliability. For example, you send a
message from Slack and you say at player
GBT go and spec out this PRD for me.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's called at chatp. It is
running on workflows and
&gt;&gt; yes, we didn't rehearse this.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So we we do have we do have uh I I
feel the pain on on agents where um
workflows are really helpful because
they give you durable overtime
execution. You can retry things, things
can fail, you can do them sequentially,
you can do all sorts of things. And so I
do think the ability for you to build
that on the back end is very helpful for
even for applications that don't have
the same kind of UI that you would have
it
&gt;&gt; because some are some are very visual
and some are going to be more headless
like some are going to be background
agents that are doing work for you. In
fact, the world is excited about the
artists formerly known as Cladbot. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Moldbot. I don't know what moldbot
means, by the way.
&gt;&gt; Well, uh, crustaceians, this is how you
know you have kids in like elementary
schools. crustaceians like lose their
shell so they mold.
&gt;&gt; Moles are right.
&gt;&gt; It's like a snake.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, got it.
&gt;&gt; And then emerge to steal your bank
account.
&gt;&gt; But so that's a beautiful example of the
background thing, right? Because you
text it and it does a bunch of stuff for
you and then it responds. So that that's
the kind of thing that we want you to be
able to build with Vzero where it's
going to use workflows. It might use
sandbox and it might be more I think
moldbot is like super general. It can do
anything and even hack your computer but
uh I I I expect a lot of really cool
agents to to work that way like you just
WhatsApp them and we'll we'll help you
build those with Vzero and
&gt;&gt; and the last thing I actually deployed
on Versell was my live moltbot
conversation. If you want to see
&gt;&gt; what it is terminal
&gt;&gt; I well I I shut the computer and walked
away. I did not enjoy my it was an
interesting experience. You can smash
that subscribe button if you want to
watch it.
&gt;&gt; But I did I did deploy to Verscell
&gt;&gt; a terminal view of my conversation with
Mulbot. So you can go it's like it's
called
&gt;&gt; confessions.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Oh that's exactly what it is.
Yeah. It's real scary
&gt;&gt; app.
&gt;&gt; Great. Maybe one more question.
&gt;&gt; Oh wow. What an honor. First of all,
thank you so much uh for hosting the
event. Thank you so much for the new
VZero. I I ship a lot with Vzero. My
co-founder is using Cursor and now we
have like a mutual compatibility.
&gt;&gt; We're so back.
&gt;&gt; Love it.
&gt;&gt; There you go. Um and so I wanted to um
again I'm also a Vzero ambassador. There
we go. Let's go. Um I wanted to ask two
questions. number one um a little bit
different but when do you think so VZero
has really democratized the ability to
go from prompt to UI UI that works uh
and UI that satisfies like the the the
prompt that the user created when do you
think that paradigm is going to happen
within consumer in Gen UI uh I see that
your team has been playing with a bunch
of different libraries different ways to
create that uh when do you think that
switch is happening and then the second
question when can I uh write a prompt
and then deploy to the app store.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So on the on the first question,
sometimes you're going to want like a
flash v0ero. So we're playing with ideas
around generative UI where an agent
might decide to render something and
think of it as like spontaneously
creating an a the UI code and then
rendering it right away. You're not
actually creating a code and an
application and deploying it. You just
want to make it happen. So we're doing a
lot of research on like what would that
look like? So it's another tool that we
can give agents on the app store
question you've seen some of the stuff
that we've been doing with vzero iOS app
react native skills a long held dream of
ours has been to really democratize
pushing to the apps are like you would
push to the web and everything here is
like sort of using that same those same
ingredients uh reactbased deployment
platform just deploy with one press of a
button and whatnot. So, uh, yeah, don't
want to promise any timelines, but, uh,
definitely something we want to do.
&gt;&gt; Thank you. Thanks everybody.
